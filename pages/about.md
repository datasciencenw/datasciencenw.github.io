## Who we are

We are a data and decision science company that provides elegant, effective, data-driven solutions to problems.

## What we do

We have to primary offers: data science solutions and hands-on training workshops. To learn more about our offers, click the [Data Science](pages/data_science.html) and [Training](pages/training.html) links above.

## How we do it

Our principles can be summarised by the following four *F.O.C.I*:

### Fit

We provide solutions *fit* to your problems. There is no one-size-fits-all solution

### Open

We are passionate about being *open*, both in the tools we use and the solutions we provide. We only use open source software (e.g.; R, Python). Moreover, we are open about the limitations of our solutions.

### Clean

Simple, elegant, *clean* solutions with no excess junk. We'd much rather provide a clean, 1 page / 100 line of code solution that does exactly what you want (and nothing more) rather than a 100 page / 10,000 line of code solution that includes a bunch of junk you don't want.

### Insightful

We donâ€™t just provide solutions, we provide actionable *insights*.
