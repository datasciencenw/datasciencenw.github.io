## Who we are

[We](team.html) are a data and decision science company that provides elegant, effective, data-driven solutions to problems. While our solutions are not domain specific, we have extensive experience in psychology, marketing, medical, and pharmaceutical applications.

We have two primary offers: data science solutions and hands-on training workshops in the R programming language, statistics, and machine learning. To learn more about our offers, click the [Data Science](data_science.html) and [Training](training.html) links above.

## F.O.C.I Principles

We have strict principles that underly everything we do. Our principles can be summarised by the following four *F.O.C.I*:

### Fit

We provide solutions *fit* to specific problems with unique goals, costs, and stakeholders. For this reason, all of our services begin with an intensive consultation where we map out the goals, priorities, costs, and stakeholders underlying each project. There is no one-size-fits-all solution.

### Open

We are passionate about being *open*, both in the tools we use and the solutions we provide. We only use open source software (e.g.; R, Python). We are also passionate about contributing to the open source community; for this reason, we offer a substantial discount when our work can be shared freely online.

### Clean

Simple, elegant, *clean* solutions with no excess junk. We'd much rather provide a clean, 1 page / 100 line of code solution that does exactly what you want (and nothing more) rather than a 100 page / 10,000 line of code solution that includes a bunch of junk you don't want or will never use.

We take pride in our work. We don't want our solutions to be used once only to fall into a prgramming dustbin. Rather, we want them to be expanded, refined, and far outlive their original use-case. For this reason, all of our work is extensively documented, fully tested, and scaleable.

### Insightful

We donâ€™t just provide applied solutions, we provide actionable *insights* that will . For example, in
