## F.O.C.I Principles

### Fit

We provide solutions fit to your problems. There is no one-size-fits-all solution

### Open

We are passionate about being open, both in the tools we use and the solutions we provide. We only use open source software (e.g.; R, Python). Moreover, we are open about the limitations of our solutions.

### Clean

Simple, elegant, no excess junk. We'd much rather provide a clean, 1 page / 100 line of code solution that does exactly what you want (and nothing more) rather than a 100 page / 10,000 line of code solution that includes a bunch of junk you don't want.

### Insightful

We donâ€™t just provide solutions, we provide actionable insights.
