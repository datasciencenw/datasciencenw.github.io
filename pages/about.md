## Who we are

[We](team.html) are a data and decision science company that provides elegant, effective, data-driven solutions to problems. While our solutions are not domain specific, we have extensive experience in psychology, marketing, medical, and pharmaceutical applications.

We have two primary offers: [data science](data_science.html) solutions and hands-on [training](training.html) workshops in the R programming language, statistics, and machine learning. To learn more about our offers, click the Data Science and Training links above.

## F.O.C.I Principles

We have strict principles that underly everything we do. Our principles can be summarised by the following four *F.O.C.I*:

### Fit

We don't provide one-size-fits-all "solutions". We provide solutions *fit* to specific problems with unique goals, costs, and stakeholders. For this reason, all of our services begin with an intensive consultation where we map out the goals, priorities, costs, and stakeholders underlying each project. 

### Open

We are passionate about being *open*, both in the tools we use and the solutions we provide. We only use open source software (e.g.; R, Python). We are also passionate about contributing to the open source community; for this reason, we offer a substantial discount when our work can be shared freely online.

### Clean

<q>The best solution in the world is useless (even worse than useless) if it is never used.</q>

The best way to ensure a solution is never used is to make it complicated, confusing and unintuitive. We don't do that. We provide simple, elegant, *clean* solutions with no excess junk. Clean solutions are those that are actually used and can be refined, expanded, and ultimately far out-live their original use-case. For this reason, we strive to provide solutions that are fully documented with examples, vignettes, and supporting visualisations that stakeholders with no statistical background can understand. 

### Insightful

We donâ€™t just strive to hit numbers, such as maximising prediction accuracy or minimising code time. We also emphasize creating solutions that provide actionable *insights* to your problems.
