## Principles

We follow the F.O.C.U.S principles:

### Fit for purpose

There is no one-size-fits-all solution

### Open

Open source tools.
Open about the pros and cons of each solution

### Clean

Simple, elegant, no excess junk

### Understandable

We don’t just provide solutions, we provide explanations. If we can’t explain a solution to a non-statistical audience, we don’t do it.

### Scaleable

We provide long-term solutions people will actually use and can scale.
R packages, functions, Shiny apps
