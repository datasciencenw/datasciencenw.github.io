## Who we are

We are a data and decision science company that provides elegant, effective, data-driven solutions to problems.

We have two primary offers: data science solutions and hands-on training workshops in the R programming language, statistics, and machine learning. To learn more about our offers, click the [Data Science](pages/data_science.html) and [Training](pages/training.html) links above.

## How we do it

We have strict principles that underly everything we do. Our principles can be summarised by the following four *F.O.C.I*:

### Fit

We provide solutions *fit* to specific problems with unique goals, costs, and stakeholders. For this reason, all of our services begin with an intensive consultation where we map out the goals, priorities, costs, and stakeholders underlying each project. There is no one-size-fits-all solution

### Open

We are passionate about being *open*, both in the tools we use and the solutions we provide. We only use open source software (e.g.; R, Python). We are also passionate about contributing to the open source community; for this reason, we offer a substantial discount when our work can be shared freely online.

### Clean

Simple, elegant, *clean* solutions with no excess junk. We'd much rather provide a clean, 1 page / 100 line of code solution that does exactly what you want (and nothing more) rather than a 100 page / 10,000 line of code solution that includes a bunch of junk you don't want.

### Insightful

We donâ€™t just provide solutions, we provide actionable *insights*.

## Our Influences

We have been greatly inspired and influenced by the following of many others who have greatly influenced how we work. To give you an idea of where we come from, here is a list of our top 10 favorite (non programming) books:

1. The Signal and the Noise by Nate Silver
2. Risk Savvy by Gerd Gigerenzer
3. Superforecasting by Dan Gardner and Philip E. Tetlock
4. Weapons of Math Destruction by Cathy O'Neil
5. Sources of Power by Gary Klein
6. Simple Heuristics that Make Us Smart by Gigerenzer, Goldstein and the ABC Research Group
7. Mindset by Carol Dweck
8. The Checklist Manifesto by Atul Gawande
