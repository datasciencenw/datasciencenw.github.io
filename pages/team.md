Dr. Nathaniel Phillips is a Decision and Data Scientist with degrees in Mathematics, and Experimental Psychology and industry experience as a data scientist in the marketing and pharmaceutical industries.

Nathaniel obtained his PhD in Cognitive Experimental psychology at the University of Basel in 2014. Over the course of his doctorate and two post-doctoral research positions, Nathaniel conducted research in the effects of competition on decision strategies, reinforcement learning in decisions under risk, and the ability of simple heuristics to perform as well as complex machine learning algorithms. Nathaniel has published articles in top scientific journals, and has given invited talks at psychology and programming conferences around the world.

In addition to his research, Nathaniel pursued his passion for education. He has taught dozens of courses from the Bachelors to the PhD level in research methods, statistics, decision making, and R programming. In parallel to teaching, he self published a free, introductory e-book on R titled [YaRrr! The Pirate's Guide to R](https://bookdown.org/ndphillips/YaRrr/) that is being used by academic and industry professionals around the world to learn the R programming language. 

Nathaniel is a strong contributer to the open source programming community. He has written and maintains several open source R packages, including [FFTrees](https://github.com/ndphillips/FFTrees) for creating and visualising fast-and-frugal decision trees, [yarrr](https://github.com/ndphillips/yarrr) for creating "pirateplots", [ShinyPsych](https://github.com/ndphillips/ShinyPsych) for creating interactive psychology experiments, and [VisualResume](https://github.com/ndphillips/VisualResume) for creating visual resumes.

In 2017, Nathaniel co-founded the [Basel R Bootcamp](http://therbootcamp.github.io), a company providing intensive programming workshops for academics and professionals in Switzerland.

In 2018, Nathaniel worked as a data scientist in the Personalised Health Care department at [Roche](http://www.roche.com), a pharmaceutical company based in Basel Switzerland. There, Nathaniel utilised large electronic medical records databases to further the vision of personalised oncology health care.

In 2019, Nathaniel returned to his beloved home state of Oregon and founded Data Science Northwest.
